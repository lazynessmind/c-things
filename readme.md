# CThings

This is a collection of programs written in C while I learn C.

**Note:** This project contains builds for **windows** only.

**Other Note:** Every program with ⚠️ means that the program uses memory related functions. Try it at your own risk.
### Content:

#### hex 

- takes a decimal number and converts it to hex.

```shell
> .\hex.exe 255
"Result for 255 => FF"
```

#### arraylist ⚠️
- dynamic arraylist that ensures capacity when needed.
  * has **Get** , **Add**, **Remove**

```shell
> .\arraylist.exe
```

### Disclaimer:

Be aware that the code may contain pretty nasty mistakes because I'm a noob at C.
Welcome to the noob C club.
